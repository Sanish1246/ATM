Please note that this Java project uses text files to store data permanently in multiple classes
So, once you have downloaded the project zip, save the text files in a folder
Preferrably, save them all in the same folder
Then, in the program, replace the path of each file with the new path in your PC
EX: Replace "C:\\TMP\\ATMDetails.txt" with "<path>\\ATMDetails.txt"
